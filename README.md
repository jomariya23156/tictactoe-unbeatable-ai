# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI  
There are 2 versions of AI  
- using Normal Minimax algorithm  
- Using Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning technique  
  
Both versions are unbeatable, but alpha-beta pruning is more optimal in term of computation time.  
In code, I have written to show the number of visited nodes to compare the difference between Normal Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning
